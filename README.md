Experiment:
        Self-Paced Reading with Moving Window

Description:
        Purpose of this experiment is to measure word or segment reading times
        in sentences, using a self-paced word/segment revealing mechanism. 
        Participant's task is to read sentences which are presented in a 
        segment-by-segment fashion. Participant reveals next segment by hitting
        a button. RT is measured from the presentation of a segment to button-
        press. Comprehension questions are implemented. Self-paced. Output: RT per segment.

        This particular SPR implementation uses a moving window: For each 
        segment the text in the segment is displayed at its normal position 
        in the sentence. The words outside the segment window are displayed 
        as underlines. In other words the visual structure of the whole 
        sentence is visible, but only the words in the segment window are 
        readable.
