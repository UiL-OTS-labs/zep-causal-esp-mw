0;1;CAUSAL;"van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) claim that discourse comprehension involves three levels of representation./
Among them, the situation model is the most important./It refers to the people, states, events, and 
actions of the mental microworld described in the text./ Situation models have been difficult to
investigate accurately for several reasons./

First, world knowledge plays a central role in building situation models, yet world knowledge is
imprecise, open-ended, vague, and minimally visible to the investigator./Second, situation models are
unique representations that embody the idiosyncratic constraints of the particular text./ It is 
difficult to identify general mechanisms when the representations are so idiosyncratic./ Third, there is
no sophisticated theory that both specifies how situation models are constructed and also is
psychologically plausible./ All this has imposed important challenges for researchers./

Cognitive psychologists still continue making efforts in finding the most suitable way to investigate 
the quality of the situation model constructed by readers";Cognitive psychologists are still looking for the best way to study the quality of the situation model.;1;Discourse comprehension, according to van Dijk and Kintsch, involves the construction of one level of representation: the situation model. ;0;According to some cognitive psychologists, previous knowledge plays a minor role in the process of discourse comprehension. ;1;Hey hey, my my.

1;1;NCAUSAL;"Generativism, the trend founded by the linguist Noam Chomsky, offered an explicit, formal
and rigorous model of language./Generativists focused on the study of syntax, leaving aside aspects 
that some scholars considered indispensable for the study of language, such as semantic, cultural, 
historical, psychological or stylistic factors./The exclusion of the semantic component from linguistic
analysis had consequences for the research scenario./

In the mid-1960s, a group of important scholars started to claim that any approach to language that 
leaves aside aspects related to meaning is extremely unnatural and incomplete./They argued that since
language is essentially a means of communication, the complete exclusion of meaning implied that a 
crucial component for human communication had been ignored./In light of this criticism, new ways of 
conducting linguistic research emerged./

Some leading scholars such as Lakoff, Fillmore or Langacker started new lines of research, in which
meaning was a central component.";Is this non-causal question A?;1;Is this question B, but in the non-causal version?;0;Is this question C?;0;Hey hey, my my. Your technician is never gonna die.;0
1;2;CAUSAL;"Van Dijk y Kintsch (1983) plantean que la comprensión del discurso involucra tres niveles de representación./
De ellos, el más importante es el modelo de situación./Hace alusión a las personas, estados, sucesos y
acciones del micromundo mental descrito en el texto./Por diversas razones, los modelos de situación han
sido difíciles de investigar con precisión./

Primero, el conocimiento del mundo tiene un papel central en la construcción de los modelos de situación;
/sin embargo, el conocimiento del mundo es impreciso, vago y mínimamente visible para el investigador./
Segundo, los modelos de situación son representaciones únicas que incorporan las restricciones 
idiosincrásicas del texto particular. Es difícil identificar mecanismos generales cuando las 
representaciones son tan idiosincrásicas./ Tercero, aun no existe ninguna teoría sofisticada y 
psicológicamente plausible que especifique cómo se construyen estos modelos./Todo esto ha impuesto
importantes desafíos a los investigadores./

Los psicólogos cognitivos aún continúan esforzándose para encontrar la manera más adecuada de 
investigar la calidad del modelo de situación que construyen los lectores.";Is this non-causal question A?;1;B?;1;C?;0;D?;1
