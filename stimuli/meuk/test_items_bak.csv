0;1;CAUSAL;"van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) claim that discourse comprehension 
involves three levels of representation./# Among them, the situation 
model is the most important./# It refers to the people, states, 
events, and actions of the mental microworld described in the text./#
Situation models have been difficult to investigate accurately for 
several reasons./#

First, world knowledge plays a central role in building situation 
models, yet world knowledge is imprecise, open-ended, vague, and 
minimally visible to the investigator./# Second, situation models are
unique representations that embody the idiosyncratic constraints 
of the particular text.#/ It is difficult to identify general 
mechanisms when the representations are so idiosyncratic./#Third,
there is no sophisticated theory that both specifies how situation
models are constructed and also is psychologically plausible./# 
All this has imposed important challenges for researchers./# 

Cognitive psychologists still continue making efforts in finding the
most suitable way to investigate the quality of the situation model
constructed by readers.
";Cognitive psychologists are still looking for the best way to study the quality of the situation model.;1;Discourse comprehension, according to van Dijk and Kintsch, involves the construction of one level of representation: the situation model. ;0;According to some cognitive psychologists, previous knowledge plays a minor role in the process of discourse comprehension. ;1;Hey hey, my my.

Generativism, the trend founded by the linguist Noam Chomsky, offered
an explicit, formal and rigorous model of language./# Generativists 
focused on the study of syntax, leaving aside aspects that some 
scholars considered indispensable for the study of language, such as
semantic, cultural, historical, psychological or stylistic factors./#
The exclusion of the semantic component from linguistic analysis had
consequences for the research scenario./#

In the mid-1960s, a group of important scholars started to claim that
any approach to language that leaves aside aspects related to meaning
is extremely unnatural and incomplete./#They argued that since 
language is essentially a means of communication, the complete 
exclusion of meaning implied that a crucial component for human 
communication had been ignored./#In light of this criticism, new ways
of conducting linguistic research emerged./#

Some leading scholars such as Lakoff, Fillmore or Langacker started 
new lines of research, in which meaning was a central component.
